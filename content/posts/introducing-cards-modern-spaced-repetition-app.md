I built **Cards** as a weekend project to replace Anki with a modern interface while keeping effective spaced repetition.

## Key Features

**Visual feedback:** Color-coded grade badges, real-time EF changes, immediate next review dates  
**Undo system:** Ctrl+Z to revert grades with full state restoration  
**Rich statistics:** EF display, last 5 grades, card age, review count  
**Two modes:** Traditional flip cards and active recall typing  
**Session preview:** Card distribution before starting

## Tech Stack

TypeScript + [Wasp framework](https://wasp-lang.dev) with SM-2 spaced repetition algorithm. Built as a vibe-coding weekend project with AI assistance, then gradually improved with evening sessions.

## Recent Updates

- Grade feedback animations and EF preview
- Complete undo functionality  
- Extended card statistics during review
- Sessions history page
- Mobile-responsive design
- Timezone customization
